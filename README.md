## External Tool Integration Guide for GenAI Chat

In certain scenarios, especially in dealing with complex arithmetic tasks such as word problems, it may be necessary to intervene in the generation process of a language model to incorporate specific outcomes accurately. This guide demonstrates the process of integrating an external tool alongside the `genai.chat` method to provide precise solutions to word problems.

### Overview:
This guide showcases the utilization of the `numexpr` tool for arithmetic operations within the context of a language model. However, this approach can be adapted to incorporate other external tools based on your requirements. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can effectively integrate external tools into the response generation process of a language model.

### Steps:

1. **Define Start and End Tags**:
   - Define specific start and end tags to delineate the text intended for input to the external tool within the model's response.

2. **Craft Prompt**:
   - Create a prompt instructing the language model on how to incorporate the start and end tags into its response effectively.

3. **Extract Text for Tool Input**:
   - Extract the text located between the start and end tags from the response generated by the language model. This extracted text serves as input for the external tool.

4. **Discard Extra Content**:
   - Discard any content following the end tag to ensure that only the relevant text is used as input for the external tool.

5. **Execute External Tool**:
   - Execute the external tool using the extracted text as input and include its output in the final response generated by the language model.

### Implementation:

```bash
pip install -q google.generativeai
```

### Note:
- Ensure that the external tool you intend to integrate is compatible with the language model and capable of providing the required functionality.
- Adjust the implementation as necessary based on the requirements of your specific use case.

### Disclaimer:
This guide is provided for informational purposes only. The integration of external tools into the generation process of a language model should be performed carefully to ensure accurate and appropriate results.

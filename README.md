# Gemini-Based-Chat-Calculator

In certain situations, you might need to intervene in the generation process of a model to incorporate particular outcomes. For instance, complex arithmetic tasks, such as word problems, can pose challenges for language models. This guide demonstrates using an external tool alongside the genai.chat method to provide the accurate solution to a word problem.

In this specific instance, we utilize the numexpr tool for arithmetic operations, but you can adapt this approach to incorporate other tools suitable for your requirements. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

Define start and end tags to delineate the text for the tool's input.
Craft a prompt instructing the model on how to utilize these tags in its response.
Extract the text between the start and end tags from the model's response to serve as input for the tool.
Discard any content following the end tag.
Execute the tool and include its output in your response.
By following this process, the model incorporates the tool's output into its response effectively.
